# Drone Clearing for Dyson Sphere Program

**DSP Drone Clearing** is a mod for the Unity game Dyson Sphere Program developed by Youthcat Studio and published by Gamera Game.  The game is available on [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1366540/Dyson_Sphere_Program/).

This mod will use mecha drones to clear trees and stones.  Ever get annoyed tripping over rocks?  This mod is for you.

Enable and disable the clearing functionality in-game with this toggle button on your HUD.

## Change Log
### v1.2.8
 - Fixed a bug which was making the drones mine too fast, 4 times faster in the later game.  The speed was correct early game.
 - Added config setting to control the drone clearing speed, faster or slower.  If you got used to the drones clearing too quickly, you can restore that functionality.
### v1.2.7
 - Bug fixed with disabling plugin while off a planet in open space.
### v1.2.6
 - Added config settings for ClearWhileDrifting and RecallWhileFlying.
 - Drone performing clearing tasks will automatically be recalled when Icarus starts sailing.
 - Added tasking status to tool tip for enable/disable button.
 - Added bug reporting link to this README.
### v1.2.5
 - Major bug fixed which was causing drone clearing tasks to go unassigned causing drone clearing to stop.
### v1.2.4
 - Improved compatibility with the Render Distance mod.
### v1.2.3
 - Added a config option to enable more debug to the BepInEx console.
### v1.2.2
 - Fixed bug when loading the game with the mod for the first time.  (Bug added in v1.2.0 with the config reload functionality.)
 - Replaced deprecated function call.
 - Manifest description updated.
### v1.2.1
 - Fixed a bug where tasks were being assigned when drones weren't available.  This was causing configured energy constraints to be violated.  This issue was emphasized when fewer drones were available.
 - Small revision to the appearance of the enable/disable HUD image.
### v1.2.0
 - Added a button to the game HUD to enable and disable drone clearing.
 - Added a config setting to explicitly enable or disable the mod.
 - Reload configuration settings on each game start.
 - Reduced debug log messages.
### v1.1.1
 - Fixed compatibility with Windows10CE's DSP Cheats's Instant-Build feature to make instant clearing.
### v1.1.0
 - Fixed bug with drones getting locked up when Icarus completes their task first.
 - Clearing tasks no longer save.  This is a compromise to avoid issues when disabling/removing the mod.
 - Fixed bug when performing Quit Game that wasn't removing drone clearing tasks.
 - Improvement in drone usage calculation.  This provides a cleaner cut-off when clearing is shutoff due to drone count usage or energy availability.
 - Disable clearing when mecha energy level is too low (configurable).
 - Optimized mechanic for holding drone still while working.
### v1.0.0
 - Initial release.
