# BuildAnywhere

Allows you to ignore grid snapping and build restrictions
This means you can build (pretty much) anywhere!

## How to use
Hold CTRL to ignore grid snapping
Hold SHIFT and R to rotate stuff 360 degrees
Hold ALT to ignore build restrictions

If you want to place conveyor belts without grid snapping,
you may have to ignore the build restrictions
