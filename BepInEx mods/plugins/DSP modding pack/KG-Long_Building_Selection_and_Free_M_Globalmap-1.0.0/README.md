1) Install BeplnEx plugin

2) Move Selection.dll into BepplnEx/plugins folder

3) Start game 

Now your building selection distance is much bigger, you can access any building from any point in planet

I also changed M button (globalmap) so its not blocking your UI, so you can use globalmap M and open any storage / fabric e.t.c for getting / setting items
