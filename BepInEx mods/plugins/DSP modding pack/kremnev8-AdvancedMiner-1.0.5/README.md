# Advanced Miner
Adds new Mining drill Mk.II that has increased range.

It is unlocked together with Assembler Mk.II in tech **High-speed assembling processes**, and is crafted with 1 Miner Mk.I 4 Titanium 2 Processors and 2 Particle container.

You can change its max radius in config file(Unrecomended, mostly because of balance,  but also because game does not handle HUGE radiuses too well and i do not intent to fix it)
Mod is using grid index 2504 and build index 204.
If you encounter any conflits with other mods you can reassign ids and grid positions with config files in Dyson Sphere Program\BepInEx\config\LDBTool

**All of the values are subject to change**
