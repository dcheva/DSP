# Free Foundations - Free Soil - Higher Build Range
## Features
With this Mod, you do not need to have any Soil(optional) or Foundations(optional) to actually build foundations. However, you need to have the Foundations unlocked already. Also optional, Higher Build Range. On top of that, the Reform-Size increases from 10x10 to 30x30.

Optionally you can disable Higher Buildrange functionality & you can also set the buildrange yourself. The default value of 250 is the maximum already though.

Checkout the config of this mod! Also make sure to use GodMode-Build-Mode (in the Game settings)
