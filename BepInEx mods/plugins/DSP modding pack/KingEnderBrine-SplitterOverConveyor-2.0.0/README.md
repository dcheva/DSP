# Description
Allows you to place a splitter on top of conveyor belts, this will automatically connect everything.

# Conditions
Placing splitter this way requires additional belts (as it would with placing vanilla way).
The type of a belt is picked based on a belt that is getting connected to splitter.
A splitter takes up a 3x3 grid which is checked for belts.
